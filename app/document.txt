Excellent question 👍 — this is one of the **most important Laravel concepts** to understand clearly.

Let’s break it down simply 👇

---

## 🧩 **1️⃣ `return view('studentview');`**

* This **directly loads** the Blade view **from the controller**.
* Laravel **does not make a new HTTP request** — it just renders the `studentview.blade.php` file immediately and sends the HTML to the browser.

✅ **Key points:**

* No URL change in the browser (it stays on the same route).
* Data can be passed easily:

  ```php
  return view('studentview', ['students' => $students]);
  ```
* Used when you just want to **show a page or data directly**.

📘 **Example:**

```php
Route::get('/student/view', [StudentController::class, 'showstudentview']);
```

If you open `/student/view`, it will simply render `studentview.blade.php`.

---

## 🔁 **2️⃣ `return redirect('/student/studentview');`**

* This does **not** render a view directly.
* It sends a **302 redirect response** to the browser → browser makes a **new GET request** to `/student/studentview`.

✅ **Key points:**

* Browser URL changes to `/student/studentview`.
* Good for **post actions**, e.g., after saving, deleting, or updating a record.
* Prevents **form resubmission** problems (Post/Redirect/Get pattern).

📘 **Example:**

```php
function addstudent(Request $request)
{
    Student::create($request->all());
    return redirect('/student/studentview')->with('success', 'Student added!');
}
```

Here, after insertion, you redirect to the “view page” — instead of reloading the form.

## ⚖️ **Summary Table**

| Action              | What Happens                       | URL Changes? | Typical Use                            |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `return view()`     | Loads Blade template immediately   | ❌ No         | To **display** a page                  |
| `return redirect()` | Tells browser to go to a new route | ✅ Yes        | After **saving / deleting / updating** |

---

💡 **Quick Analogy:**

* `view()` → “Show this file right now.”
* `redirect()` → “Go visit that route/page now.”

Would you like me to show an example where **both are used together**, like saving a student record and redirecting **with data + success message**?
